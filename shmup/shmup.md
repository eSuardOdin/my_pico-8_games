# Shoot my game up

First game of my learning game dev / pico8 project.

A basic shoot'm up, enemies spawns and you need to defeat them, this game is not intended to be content focused, levels will be proceduraly generated (I don't even know if I can talk about levels for now)

## Mechanics

### Impemented

- Moving the ship on screen
- Firing gun
- Spawning enemies
- Ship's life
- Invicibility period on being hit
- Hitbox mechanic (shooting on enemy destroys them and getting struck by them make ship loose a life)

### Partially implemented

- Weapon type
- Enemy type

### To do

- Score system
- Bonus (Shield, Hp up ?)
- New weapon
